### 📉 Estimation Methods (TDoA & Path Loss Models)

For the classical multilateration techniques, specific estimation methods were employed to solve the systems of non-linear equations. TDoA-based position estimation relies on hyperbolic range difference equations, which are often solved using non-linear least square estimation, an approach first introduced by Foy. This iterative process refines an assumed initial coordinate $(x_0, y_0)$ by minimizing the sum of the squared errors from a residual function. The range-based estimations, which use path loss models like the Okumura-Hata model and the COST-231 Walfisch-Ikegami model, calculate the distance $d$ from the received signal strength. Once the distances are calculated, the final position coordinates are approximated using iterative least-square estimation methods, specifically the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

### 💡 Core Concept: Fingerprinting with Climate Data

Traditional GNSS-free localization methods for LoRaWAN, which operates in the sub-gigahertz spectrum, introduce non-negligible errors in localization estimation. The proposed solution is to predict the coordinates of end devices from the pattern of signal strength variation and receiving gateway constellations at different environmental conditions.

The performance comparison in the paper shows the superior accuracy of the proposed weather-aware fingerprinting methods (FP-wx-RF and FP-wx-KNN):

| Method | Mean Error (meters) | Median Error (meters) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FP-wx-RF: Random Forest Based Fingerprinting with weather data (Proposed)** | **230**  | **112**  |
| FP-wx-KNN: KNN Based Fingerprinting with weather data (Proposed) | 263  | 137  |
| FP-RF: Ranfom Based Fingerprinting (Baseline) | 273  | 165  |
| FP-KNN: KNN Based Fingerprinting (Baseline) | 301  | 185  |
| TDoA | 732  | 765  |
| PLM-OH: Pathloss Model and RSSI based estimation (Okumura-Hata) | 1,700  | 1,080  |

### 📈 Methodology & Workflow

The study's workflow, depicted in Figure 2, involves data acquisition, processing, estimation, and evaluation.

#### 1. Data Acquisition

* **LoRaWAN Data:** The study used an open-source dataset collected from Antwerp, Belgium in 2019 , containing 130,430 LoRaWAN messages from sensors utilizing a network of 72 gateways.
* **Weather Data:** Historical weather data was collected using Open-Meteo.
* **Correlation:** The LoRaWAN data was correlated with the historical weather data using GPS coordinates and timestamps.

#### 2. Processing

* The dataset was filtered to retain only samples received by **at least four gateways** , resulting in **55,303 data samples**.
* The **min-max scaling method** was used for normalization.

#### 3. Position Estimation (Training)

* The dataset was divided into a **70% training set** and a **30% testing set**.
* **5-fold cross-validation** was used to further generalize the models.
* **Algorithms:** The primary machine learning algorithms evaluated were **k-nearest neighbor (KNN) Regressor** and **Random Forest (RF) Regressor**.

#### 4. Model Evaluation

* Models were evaluated by calculating the **Haversine distance** between the predicted coordinates and the ground truth values.
